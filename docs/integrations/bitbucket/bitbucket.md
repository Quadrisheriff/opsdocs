# Bitbucket

## Overview

JupiterOne provides a managed integration with Bitbucket. The integration
connects directly to Bitbucket APIs to obtain account metadata and analyze
resource relationships. Customers authorize access by creating a Bitbucket OAuth
App in their account and providing the app credentials to JupiterOne.

## Integration Instance Configuration

The integration is triggered by an event containing the information for a
specific integration instance.

The integration instance configuration requires the customer's Bitbucket OAuth
App `clientId` and `clientSecret` to authenticate requests to the Bitbucket REST
APIs. The integration requires Read access to the target Account, Team
Membership, Projects, and Repositories.

See the following screenshot for an example configuration within a Bitbucket
Team Settings, note the required and optional settings.

_Pull requests read permission is needed to ingest PRs. The PR entities serve as
code review records for security and compliance._

## Entities

The following entity resources are ingested when the integration runs:

| Bitbucket Entity Resource | \_type : \_class of the Entity            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Team                      | `bitbucket_team` : `Account`              |
| Project                   | `bitbucket_project` : `Project`           |
| Pull Request              | `bitbucket_pull_request` : `Review`, `PR` |
| Repository                | `bitbucket_repo` : `CodeRepo`             |
| User                      | `bitbucket_user` : `User`                 |
