# JupiterOne Insights Dashboards

JupiterOne **Insights** app allows users to build reporting dashboards using
J1QL queries.

Each dashboard can be configured as either a **Team** board that is shared with
other account users or a **Personal** board for the individual user. Charts of
a Team board are shared.

The layout of each board is individually saved per user, including the layout
for Team boards, so that each user may configure layouts according to their own
preferences without impacting others.  Administrators can save a Team board
layout as "default" for other users.

Here are a few example boards and their configurations:

- [AWS Resources Dashboard](../dashboards/dashboard-aws-resources.md)
- [Data Security Dashboard](../dashboards/dashboard-data-security.md)
- [Development and Secure SDLC Dashboard](../dashboards/dashboard-development.md)
- [Firewall Configurations Dashboard](../dashboards/dashboard-firewall.md)
- [User Access Dashboard](../dashboards/dashboard-user-access.md)
